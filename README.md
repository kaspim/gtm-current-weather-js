There are two variables you need to define:
* The API key ```apikey``` that you get at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/price). This service offers free access with a limit of 60 calls per minute.
* Time to store ```expire``` weather information in cookies. By saving information, you avoid unnecessary API calls.
